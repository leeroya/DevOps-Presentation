# What are containers and why do we need them

## What

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime when they run on an engine the supports containerd. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. 

Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

## Why

With the ever-growing demand on experimenting and failing forward  the need for a technology or tool to help speed up delivery containers by its inherent nature include all the items that are required for the software to run in isolation allowing the ability to experiment new versions of frameworks, tools or even custom code pushing developers into a more DevOps centric manner.
